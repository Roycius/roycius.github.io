            <p>This module introduces students to the development of a large system from conceptualisation to its final
                implementation. It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software
                components. This module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which
                students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone
                project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the
                Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.</p>

        <p>The main gist of the project is to utilize various techonologies such as microcontrollers, bluetooth low
            energy communications, augmented reality and AI, to come up to with a lazer tag game.</p>

        <p>The project is split up into 5 main components, Hardware, Internal Comms, External Comms, AI, and Visualizer
            + Game Engine. The component I was in charge of was Internal Communications.</p>

        <p>My main role is to utilize a Linux laptop to communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy microcontrollers. The main
            objective is to send hardware sensor data from the microcontrollers to the laptop, which will then relay
            them to a server.</p>

        <p>The system uses Arduino Bluno microcontrollers send bytes to the Linux laptop using Bluetooth Low Energy
            communication, which then is received, processed and relayed using Python. Communication reliability is also
            ensured by utilizing various error detection methods and protocols.</p>
