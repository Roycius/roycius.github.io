            <p>Real-time systems must respond quickly to inputs from the environment in order to work effectively and
                safely, and realtime operating systems (RTOS) are a critical part of such systems. In this course the
                student is exposed to basic RTOS concepts like tasks, scheduling algorithms, RTOS customisation and
                concurrent real-time programming. By the end of this course a student will not only understand how an
                RTOS is built, but will also gain practical hands-on experience in customising RTOSs and in writing
                real-time programs.</p>

        <p>This module teaches us RTOS concepts and apply them through a project. In the project, we were tasked to
            program a KL25Z board to run several threads on our bot, such as powering motors, playing music through a
            buzzer, controlling LEDs, and obtaining readings from the Ultrasonic Sensor. The bot is then remote
            controlled through wireless serial communication from a mobile phone app to an ESP32 board. We also had to
            set up a self-drive mode where the bot has to move forward till it detects a cone, make a loop around it,
            then move back to the starting point.</p>
