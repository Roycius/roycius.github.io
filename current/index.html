        <h2 class="border-bottom border-dark py-2">CG3207 Computer Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This course teaches students the basics in the design of the various classes of microprocessors.
                Contents include design of simple micro-controllers, high performance CPU design using parallel
                techniques, memory organization and parallel processing systems. Topics also include the development of
                support tools to enable efficient usage of the developed microprocessor. The course emphasizes practical
                design and includes a group project for students to design and implement a microprocessor with
                verification on a FPGA.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="border-bottom border-dark py-2">EE4211 Data Science for the Internet of Things</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This course covers data analytics for the Internet of Things. It starts with an introduction to the
                Internet of Things (IoT) systems, including the enabling technologies, IoT network architectures and
                protocols. IoT systems have applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, smart power grids, and
                healthcare. The course then covers data science fundamentals such as Bayesian statistics,
                classification, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. The course also covers
                basic machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines,
                and neural networks. Students will visualize and analyze real-world data sets via practical IoT case
                studies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="border-bottom border-dark py-2">CS4226 Internet Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This course aims to focus on advanced networking concepts pertaining to the modern Internet architecture
                and applications. It covers a range of topics including network performance (throughput, delay, Littleâ€™s
                Law and M/M/1 queuing formula), and resource allocation and buffer management (max-min fair, round-robin
                and RED), intra- and inter-domain routing (RIP, OSPF and BGP), congestion control and modern variations
                of TCP (AIMD and Cubic TCP), peer-to-peer applications and content delivery networks (BitTorrent, Skype,
                Akamai), and data center networking and management (SDN and OpenFlow).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="border-bottom border-dark py-2">ST3248 Statistical Learning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Statistical learning is a large collection of computer-based modelling and prediction tools with
                applications in diverse fields including business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy. This
                series of two courses covers many of the popular approaches for a variety of statistical problems. There
                is heavy emphasis on the implementation of these methods on real-world data sets in the popular
                statistical software package R. Part I gives a broad overview of the common problems as well as their
                most popular approaches. Topics include linear regression model and its extensions, classification
                methods, resampling methods, regularisation and model selection, principal components and clustering
                methods.</li>
        </ul>
